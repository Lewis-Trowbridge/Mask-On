# Mask On
 
## What is it?
So you know when in sci-fi movies there's always that character who has the helmet/armour that lights up when they talk? I thought that was cool, and thought I could do the same thing in real life now that we're wearing face masks everywhere. This is meant to be used with an Adafruit Circuit Playground, which then slips into your mask.

## How do I use it?

This is fairly simple to set up. Just compile and upload the code to the Circuit Playground, make sure you power it correctly (I used a 3xAA battery holder to JST to power it remotely) and it should function immediately.
